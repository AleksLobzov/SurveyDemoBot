# SurveyDemoBot

This simple bot is to illustrate bot usage for managing surveys.

Bot loads questions (of Likert scale answers type) from Affirmations.txt and sends them to the user. The user's answers are written into Answers.txt. The survey is repeated everytime when the user runs /start command or when all questions are answered
